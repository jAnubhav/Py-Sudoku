# Sudoku
A classy sudoku game made using python tkinter.

Sudoku is a game of numbers. You need to fill every row, column and box with numbers between 1-9.

### Entering a number
When a number from the input box is selected the background of the selected number becomes black in input group and blue in the grid.
