# Sudoku
A classy sudoku game made using python tkinter.

Sudoku is a game of numbers. It requires all the boxes in the grid to be filled with the numbers from 1 to 9 satisfying the condition that no number is repeated within a row or column.

### Initially
The sudoku made by me looks like this:

### Entering a number
When a number from the input box is selected the background of the selected number becomes black in input group and blue in the grid.

On pressing the check button from the menubar, all numbers on the wrong positions become red in color.

Once you have completed the sudoku, press finish. If you have done all correct then the game will end displaying the message of success.
